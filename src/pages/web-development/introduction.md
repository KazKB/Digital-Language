## All About Web Development

Web Development is the development of websites and web applications. But that is not all web development is focused on. The maintenance and frequent updates of the website and wep application are also key roles within web development. This is because the creation and upload of a website or web application to a web server is not everything. Routine check ups, updates of relevant information and features, and introduction of new features actually take up the most time of web development. After all technology and languages are constantly evolving so the websites and web applications have to evolve as well.

### Website Vs Web Applications  

The products of web development are the traditional website and the new school web application. Websites are a set of webpages built around a common theme and purpose. While web applications are applications that are accessible through a web browser. Meaning that there is no need to download anything. Though both have their differences they are uploaded to a web server which allows users to gain access to them through a web browser.

### Tools & Equipment  

To create a website or web application, one will need servers, databases, domains, certificates, knowledge of programming languages, and a text editor and/or a integrated development environment (ide). What are these? Don't worry, each will be briefly explained.  

* Certificate - digital accreditation that states that a website is authentic and has a secured encryption meaning it is safe to use.
* Database - a collection of organized data that can be manipulated by adding, deleting and moving data. A database is essentially an advanced form of a file manager that can be linked to websites, applications and games.
* Domain Name - an identifier in place of an ip address.
* IP Address - a location address that links the service (website for example) to a device (server for example) on a network.
* Server - a computer whose main purpose is to store, manage and process data, devices and systems. There are many different kinds for example a web server or application server. Websites and web applications both use a web server (holds website and web application files and transfer them to a web browser). But the thing is that web applications also need an application server (holds application data).

### Web Developers  

A Web Developer is the person who creates websites and web applications. They bring designs to life through their programming skills. Primarily all a web developer has to do is code, but they can benefit from having design skills. That is because they will be apart of the whole creation process and even have more of a say in the direction it goes.  

Web Developers can fall under three categories. They are Front-End, Back-End and Full Stack (both Front-End and Back-End). The Front-End Developers deal more with the UI and UX side. While Back-End Developers deals with data movement and manipulation. As for Full Stack Developers, they deal with everything (UI, UX and Data Movement and Manipulation).
